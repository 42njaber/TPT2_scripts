; This script launches the main cycle loop on the same frame it is executed,
; and then goes on to count the number of elapsed cycles since its execution.

:global int turbo.cycles

execute("TE2.0 cycle loop")
turbo.cycles = 1
turbo.cycles += 1
; Since scripts aren't removed from the script list as long as turbo is
; running, their last instructions are instead run every cycle. This allows
; repeating the same instruction each cycle.
