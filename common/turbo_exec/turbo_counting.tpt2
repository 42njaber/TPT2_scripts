; This script launches the main cycle loop on the same frame it is executed,
; and then goes on to count the number of elapsed cycles since its execution.

:global int turbo.cycles

turbo.cycles = 0
turbo.cycles += 1
; Since scripts aren't removed from the script list as long as turbo is
; running, their last instructions are instead run every cycle. This allows
; repeating the same instruction each cycle.
