#### Q: Is turbo exec gonna be fixed?

A: Yes, when the devs rework the AI, they'll add more "legitimate" ways to do what turbo exec is doing, and they will then patch turbo exec.

#### Q: What's the purpose of making this package for turbo exec? Couldn't each script just use the bug directly?

This package is aimed to make it is easy for multiple scripts to use turbo exec without interfeering with eachother.
